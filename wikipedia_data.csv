Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,"

On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state which consists of the larger part of Kashmir which has been the subject of dispute among India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]

Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation was the cutting off of communication lines in the Kashmir Valley which was restored after 5 months.[3] Thousands of additional security forces were deployed to curb any uprising.[4] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister.[5][4] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preempting violence,[6] and justified the revocation for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[7]

The reactions in Kashmir Valley was effectively suppressed through the suspension of communication and with imposition of Curfew (Section 144).[5][4][8] Many nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[5] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telugu Desam Party, YSR Congress Party, BJD, Janata Dal (United) and the Shiv Sena. It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Trinamool Congress and the DMK.[9] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are predominantly Shia Muslim, protested;[10][11] however, the Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[12][13]

The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the temporary special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[14] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[4][15][16]

Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir — a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[17][18] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[19] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to residents of other Indian states.[20]


Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments — such as those of the National Conference — between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[21][22][23] Political scientist Sumantra Bose, a Kashmir scholar, sums up the politics of the period 1953–63, during which Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad served as the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in these words:
 Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed’s term in office lasted a full decade, until October 1963. The sequence of events during that decade strongly suggests a contractual relationship between Bakshi and the government of India, whereby he would be allowed to run an unrepresentative, unaccountable government in Srinagar in return for facilitating IJK’s ""integration"" with India on New Delhi’s terms. The result was twofold: a crippling of rule of law and democratic institutions in IJK; and an erosion of IJK’s autonomy, achieved (as required by Article 370) with the ""concurrence"" of IJK’s government—which consisted of a motley clique of New Delhi's client politicians.""[24]
 Further, in Bose's view, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[25]

Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[26][need quotation to verify] As in past election manifestos, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[27][28] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[29][30] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[31]

On 5 August 2019, some political parties of Jammu and Kashmir met at the home of Farooq Abdullah and released a joint statement, called Gupkar Declaration, that pledged to defend and safeguard the identity, autonomy and special status of Jammu and Kashmir.[32]

Article 370 of the Constitution of India was a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[33] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extend the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[34] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[33]

After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[35][36] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[37] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[38]

In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[39] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[33] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[40]

The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[18][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (dissolved in 1957)[43] state constituent assembly to do so.[33] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[44][45] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[44][33] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[33]

Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[33] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[14] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[15][16]

On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[46][47] The court also issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, whereby declining pleas by the government which argued that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations.[47] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[48]

The Supreme Court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories came into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[49]

In an article for the Indian Law Review, Balu G. Nair noted the orders to be ""constitutionally suspect"".[50] Deva Zaid finds the orders to be extra-constitutional.[51] Rajeev Dhavan opined that Art. 370 can't be ""abrogated"".[52] Gautam Bhatia found the entire episode to be fraught with legal and constitutional defects.[53] Suhrith Parthasarathy opined the orders to be unconstitutional.[54]

On 11 December 2023, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India unanimously upheld the Indian Government's decision to abrogate Article 370. The bench said that article 370 of the Constitution was a 'temporary provision' and the president had the power to revoke it.[55] They also recommended that elections be held in Jammu and Kashmir before 30 September 2024.[56]

Supreme Court Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said that there would be a commission necessary to investigate human rights incidents since 1980 whether they were committed by state or non-state actors.[57]

Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[58] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[58] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[59] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[59] However, on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[58]

On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[58] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[60] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[61][62] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[61]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[63]

Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Muslim & Buddhist populated Ladakh region.[64][65][66] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[67][68] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[61] Shops and clinics were closed,[60] as were all educational institutions[63] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[58] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[65]

Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[69] Journalists were not issued curfew passes.[61] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[70] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[71] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[72][73] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[74]

In addition to local Kashmiri journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams have not been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[69] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[69]

More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[75][76] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[77][78] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[79] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[79] by the security forces.[58]

In January 2020, Human Rights Watch reported that the Indian government-imposed clampdown in Kashmir is being slowly and gradually eased of restrictions, but to a large extent continues to fail in preserving the rights of the Kashmiri people. The lawyers, shop keepers, rights activists, students, who had been under arrest have been released, but on the condition of never criticising the government in the future again. Meanwhile, some notable political figures including former chief ministers, too, continue to remain in custody.[80]

India's Foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[6] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[81]

The Government of Jammu and Kashmir stated that the restrictions on Internet access, among other restrictions, were imposed to preempt the disruption of public order by various ""anti-national"" elements. It said that the misuse of data services and Internet by ""terrorists"" to conduct terrorism and to incite people by spreading fake news necessitated such restrictions, which will be gradually reduced.[82]

On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[83] According to Reuters, telephone services were to be resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019, only to face delays in implementation.[84] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[83] Central government was adamant about reopening schools in the valley in the week of 19 August 2019 amid curfew-like situation.[84] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[85][86] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[83][87]

As of 25 August 2019, landline services were restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[88] On September 4, only 50,000 landline connections were operational throughout the valley.[89] On 14 October 2019, postpaid mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[90] As of 3 January 2020, mobile Internet has still not been fully restored in the region. At 153 days and counting, this has become the largest internet shutdown in India.[91]

On 13 January 2020, an article by Reuters reported that the Internet services have not been fully restored in Kashmir, forcing Kashmiris to board a crowded train – dubbed as the 'Internet Express' – to travel to a nearby town of Banihal for using Internet at cybercafes for 300 rupees ($4.20) an hour. The Vice President of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Majeed Mir, claims almost 500,000 jobs have been lost since the blockade, stating that ""irreversible damage has been caused to the economy"".[92]

On 14 January 2020, broadband Internet services were restored to select organizations/individuals in the Kashmir Valley and 2G mobile services were restored in five districts located in the Jammu region.[93][82]

On 18 January 2020, 2G Internet service was restored for 153 white listed websites in all the 10 districts of Jammu Division and in 2 districts Kupwara and Bandipura of Kashmir Valley for postpaid mobile service. Voice call and SMS services were also restored for the whole Union Territory.[94][95][96][97]

On 25 January 2020, 2G Internet services were restored for all 20 districts on both pre-paid and postpaid mobiles for 301 white-listed websites.[98][99][100][101]

As of 26 February 2020, broadband Internet services remain banned to the general public. Until 4 March 2020, the number of whitelisted websites were increased. Still only 2G Internet service was accessible. On 4 March 2020, Internet services were fully restored but restricted to 2G Internet speed.[102][103]

From July 2020, the Indian Union government will allow Indian security forces to buy land in certain areas of the Indian administered Kashmir. This is a reversal from an earlier policy, where the Indian security forces had to request special permission to buy land in the area. Only locals were able to buy land in Indian administered Kashmir, however, with the government scrapping Kashmir's autonomy, Indian security forces can buy land and live in Kashmir.[104]

On 16 August 2020, high speed mobile internet services (4G/LTE) were restored in two districts of the union territory of J&K on a trial basis, after Supreme Court of India ruled last month that indefinite shutdown was illegal.[105]

In a verdict delivered on petitions filed against the restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court ordered a review of all the curbs on usage of Internet services. The court pointed out that freedom to access Internet services is a fundamental right as per Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution. It also noted that Section 144 of India's Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be used for suppressing people's expression, ordering the local administration to publish every usage of that provision to enable its public scrutiny.[106]

The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[5][112]

Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[113]

Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[114]

Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[115][116][117] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[118]

The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[119] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[120][121]

The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[122] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[123] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[12][13]

Many local political parties and groups, such as the Kashmiri Hindu organisation Panun Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir Workers Party and IkkJutt Jammu lauded the removal of Article 370 and 35A and the integration of Jammu and Kashmir.[124][125][126]

It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[127][128][129]

Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu Community, who were displaced[130] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[131][132] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[133] will be able to return.[134]

The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[135][136] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[137]

The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[138][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[139] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[5]

Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[140] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[141]

Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[142]

Wajahat Habibullah said the government's decision was a ""regressive and unwise"" step.[143]

The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[144][145] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[146] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[147] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[148] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[149]

Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[150]

On 24 August, a delegation of opposition leaders had attempted to visit Jammu and Kashmir to take stock of the situation. The delegation was a 12-member team composed of Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, K. C. Venugopal, Anand Sharma, D. Raja, Sitaram Yechury, Dinesh Trivedi, Tiruchi Siva, Manoj Jha, Sharad Yadav, Majeed Memon, and D. Kupendra Reddy. However, the team was sent back upon reaching Srinagar.[151]

Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protesters asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[152] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[9]

The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[153] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[154][155] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[153]

Arjun Sharma, a noted freelance journalist from Jammu penned in his article that while Ladakh was rejoicing the UT status it got after disintegration of J&K, Jammu was suspicious of whether the perceived discrimination towards Jammu will end or not.

The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[7]

The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".[4]

The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an overwhelming majority of support in the Indian parliament.[5] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[156][9]

Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action.
